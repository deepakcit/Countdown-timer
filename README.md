# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

                                   Create a countdown timer


The user provides the starting point of the countdown timer and accordingly the timer sets off, decrementing by 1 every second until it reaches 0.
You are given an Input field that takes input from the user (#timeCount).
This input field should take an integer and should trigger the countdown timer when enter key is pressed in the keyboard
The timer should be triggered by keyboard-event(keyDown) after the input is typed.
When enter is pressed, the div(#current-time) gets updated with the initial value of the timer(the rounded off input or 0 for invalid input) and then decrements by 1 after each second
Only display the number in div(#current-time), i.e., if 5 seconds are left, it should render 5.
The timer should decrement by 1 every second until it reaches 0. e. g 3, 2, 1, 0
Don't change the structure of the returned HTML component from App.js.
On enter keyboard-event of user timer should start counting depending on the following conditions.
If an integer is given then the time should start counting.
If invalid input is given then display 0 in the output(#current-time).
The timer should stop after it reach to 0 and should continue to display 0 till a new event is triggered.
If the user enter a new input before the last timer is finished then terminate the previous one and start the new one.
If the user types in a floating number, take the floor. Eg: If user types 4.3, the timer should start with 4. If the user types 4.8, the timer should still start with 4
